Hi,

I need to be able to write a screenshot to the Downloads folder when the user presses the keyboard shortcut Command+S. This functionality is called out to the user on the HUD display that appears when first launching the app.
This screenshot is different to a normal screenshot in that Quick Draw hides the palette first.

Cheers,
MaxC
