# Quick Draw
A macOS app for drawing over the screen

## Motivation
1. I  mentor an online Swift course and would like a quick, easy and unobtrusive way to highlight and describe code during video calls
2. I would like to increase my experience in macOS development (I am an iOS developer)
3. I would like to experiment with creating a simple architecture that has no third party dependencies

## To Do
- Multi screen support (based on pointer)
- Improve arrow direction algorithm. Currently drawing a westward arrow slowly results in the arrowhead spinning around as the line's slope tries to loop
