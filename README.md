# Quick Draw
Do you need a quck, easy and unobtrusive way to highlight content while screencasting?
Rather than circling your mouse around wildly, try QuickDraw!

When QuickDraw is active, you can draw lines, arrows, rectangle and circles over other windows on your screen. Press the escape key to clear the drawing, and press it again to jump right back to where you were without missing a beat!

## Motivation
1. I  mentor an online Swift course and would like a quick, easy and unobtrusive way to highlight and describe code during video calls
2. I would like to increase my experience in macOS development (I am an iOS developer)
3. I would like to experiment with creating a simple architecture that has no third party dependencies
